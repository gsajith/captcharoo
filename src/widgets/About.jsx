            Captcharoo is the world&apos;s first{" "}
            <strong>Proof of Humanity as a Service</strong> (PoHaaS). It is a
            simple and secure way to verify that you&apos;re talking to a human
            being and not a bot.

            <h2>
              <strong>How it works</strong>
            </h2>
            <ol>
              <li>
                On the <Link href="/">Home page</Link>, you can write a secret
                phrase and <i>lock it</i> behind a Captcha.
              </li>
              <li>
                Captcharoo will generate a unique link that you can share to
                anyone you want to verify as human.
              </li>
              <li>
                When they click on the link, they&apos;ll be presented with the
                Captcha.
              </li>
              <li>
                If they solve it correctly, they&apos;ll be able to see your
                secret phrase.
              </li>
              <li>
                If they say your secret phrase back to you, you can be
                reasonably sure you&apos;re not speaking to a bot (until Captcha
                is defeated by the AI&apos;s ü•≤).
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>
              <strong>Just a heads up</strong>
            </h2>
            <br />
            Any phrase you lock with Captcharoo will be encrypted and stored in
            our database. They won&apos;t be stored as plain text, but it would
            still be best to not write anything sensitive as your secret phrase.

            The inspiration for Captcharoo came when I saw articles about{" "}

                The AI algorithm will ‚Äúswipe on girls that are just your type

                chatbot talks with the women, until they agree to go on a date
                and arrange a time and place to meet. The date then gets added
                to the CupidBot user&apos;s calendar.

            I&apos;m in favor of building tools which fight against the
            AI-ificiation of our human interactions, so that&apos;s where
            Captcharoo comes in. Next time you&apos;re chatting with someone on
            a dating app, slide them a Captcharoo!
